Once upon a time in a world ruled by humans, 
evil was risingd. 
An evil scientis had a plan to destroy all humanity 
and rule the world with robots under his command. 

!!LEVEL 1

Once he had the design for the robots, 
they started a mass production. 
But short after the first batch of robots were released in a test area, 
the evil creator discovered a problem in their circuits, 
enabling them to have the power of feeling and emotions.
because of that, 
they labeled the robots as defect
and destroyed them.

!!LEVEL 2

But from all those robots who where destroyed, 
there was one robot that survived!
His name was gearfreed.
He rised from the pile old robots 
as sole survivor.
He did not know what happened, 
but he was sure of this:
He wanted to be free
and he wanted the world to be free!

!!LEVEL 3

Escaping the factory would be a challenge.
As there are many enemies to face
The new batch of enemies, 
the stronger and emotionless enemies he needed to take out 
to free the world of evil.
But Gearfreed would not give up.
He would do everything to free himself and free the world.

!!Level 4
!!END

When he finally escaped he found himself lost in this one thought.
Though he was able to feel human emotions
He was not human 
There was this tiny bit of evil inside of him 
and to free the world 
and to free himself....

*bomb*

But that is not the end. 
A brave kid found him
and that kid was me.
I was scared
But i was also feeling that i needed to help this robot
Because he freed us.

I replaced the evil with good. 
Now he was able to see the world in colors 
He is finally free 
He is happy 
He is Gearfreed.
